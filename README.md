LHL Node Skeleton
=========

## Project Setup

The following steps are only for _one_ of the group members to perform.

1. Create your own copy of this repo using the `Use This Template` button, ideally using the name of your project. The repo should be marked Public
2. Verify that the skeleton code now shows up in your repo on GitHub, you should be automatically redirected
3. Clone your copy of the repo to your dev machine
4. Add your team members as collaborators to the project so that they can push to this repo
5. Let your team members know the repo URL so that they use the same repo (they should _not_ create a copy/fork of this repo since that will add additional workflow complexity to the project)


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information
  - username: `labber`
  - password: `labber`
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Project Specific Requirements

Option 8: Buy/Sell Listing Website

 - An app where you can put different types of things up for sale. You can pick a specific niche of items to sell for the app (a cars site, a shoes site, etc). This lets buyers find the items they are looking for quickly, and easily contact sellers.
 - stretch: listings will have a timestamp of when the listing was posted

# Users (buyers) can:

 - As a user, I want to have a profile with my username and id # associated with my account because I want the site to remember me
 - As a user, I want to have links to a search, and my favorite items in my navbar because I want to be able to access them quickly and easily
 - As a user, I want to see featured items on the main feed because I want to - see specific items in my interests
 - As a user, I want to filter my search by price and artist because I only want to see listings within my budget
 - As a user, I want to favorite items because I want to check on them later
 - As a user, I want to buy items by contacting the seller directly
 - As a user, I want to send messages to the seller because I want to be able to negotiate for my purchase
 - stretch: As a user, I want to be able to rate sellers because I want to know who is trustworthy and good to deal with
 - stretch: As a user, I want the ability to become an admin by clicking a premium user button on my profile because I want to sell more things

# Admins (sellers) can:

 - As an admin, I want to post items which can be seen by others
 - As an admin, I want to remove items from the site if it is no longer for sale or any other reason
 - As an admin, I want to mark sold items as SOLD!
 - As an admin, I want to send a message to the user about sale conditions app, email on negotiations in buying the said item
